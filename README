HOW TO BUILD A FIRMWARE FOR THE ACTIONTEC WECB3000

* How to install the WECB source code onto the Linux workstation
* How to build the image file that can be loaded on to a Actiontec WECB

NOTE: The following procedures are known to work with recent version of 
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Desktop.  

The Actiontec WECB Source Code can be obtained from the Actiontec 
support website at http://opensource.actiontec.com.

1.(Install clean OS Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Desktop.)

2.(Download source code.)

 WECB-VZ-GPL.tgz
  
3.(Copy or Move the source code to your working directory.)

$ cp WECB-VZ-GPL.tgz  /<working directory>

4.(Install required packages. Please make sure you have installed necessary lib for compile the project)

$ sudo apt-get -y install gcc g++ m4 binutils patch bzip2 flex bison make autoconf gettext texinfo unzip sharutils subversion build-essential libncurses5-dev ncurses-term zlib1g-dev
$ sudo apt-get -y install linux-headers-`uname -r` libnewt-dev curl sox libssl-dev
$ sudo apt-get -y install gawk flex gettext mtd-utils util-linux

5.(Extract the GPL source code and toolchain to your working directory. Make sure your
   working directory path does not contain spaces.)

$ tar xvfz WECB-VZ-GPL.tgz 

IMPORTANT: Extracting the source code creates the directory "WECB-VZ-GPL" 

6.(Change to the WECB-VZ-GPL directory)

$ cd <working directory>/WECB-VZ-GPL/rtl819x

7. run
$./do_act_build VERIZON WCB3000V

Notes: If there are some syntax errors occured (Maybe in Ubuntu system), make sure that your /bin/sh is linked to the bash not the dash
$ sudo rm /bin/sh
$ sudo ln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh

   
8.(Binary will be under. <working directory>/WECB-VZ-GPL/rtl819x/image/VERIZON-WCB3000V-?verion?-act.bin)
